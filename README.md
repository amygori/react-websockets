# React Websockets

A minimal chat app made with `create-react-app`. It uses websockets via [`react-use-websocket`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-use-websocket) and is designed to work an API implemented with [`django-channels`](https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html).

## Run the app locally

Install dependencies with `npm` and run the server with `npm start`.

## Environment variables

Set `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL` for login and chat with the backend API.
